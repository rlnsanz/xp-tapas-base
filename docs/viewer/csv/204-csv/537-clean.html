<td>Description</td>
<td>Absorbable biological suture material. Plain is an absorbable suture made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from bovine intestines. The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol containing solution. Plain is absorbed by enzymatic degradation.</td>
<td>Absorbable biological suture material. Chromic is an absorbable suture made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from bovine intestines. Due to undergoing a ribbon stage chromicisation (treatment with chromic acid salts), the chromic offers roughly twice the stitch-holding time of plain catgut. The natural chromic thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol containing solution. Chromic is absorbed by enzymatic degradation. Note – catgut is no longer used in the UK for human surgery.</td>
<td>It is a synthetic absorbable suture material. Braided synthetic absorbable multifilament made of polyglycolic acid and coated with N-laurin and L-lysine, which render the thread extremely smooth, soft and knot safe.</td>
<td>It is a synthetic absorbable suture material. Monofilament synthetic absorbable suture, prepared from the polyester, poly (p-dioxanone).</td>

<tr>
<td>Precautions</td>
<td>Special precautions should be taken in patients with cancer, anemia and malnutrition conditions. They tend to absorb the sutures at a higher rate. Cardiovascular surgery, due to the continued heart contractions. It is absorbed much faster when used in the mouth and in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms. Avoid using where long term tissue approximation is needed. Absorption is faster in infected tissues</td>

Special precautions should be taken in patients with cancer, anemia and malnutrition conditions. They tend to absorb this suture at a higher rate.</td>
<td>Special precautions should be taken in elderly patients and patients with history of anemia and malnutrition conditions. As with any suture material, adequate knot security requires the accepted surgical technique of flat and square ties.</td>
<td>The PDS suture knots must be properly placed to be secure. Conjunctival and vaginal mucosal sutures remaining in place for extended periods may be associated with localized irritation. Subcuticular sutures should be placed as deeply as possible in order to minimize the erythema and induration normally associated with absorption.</td>
