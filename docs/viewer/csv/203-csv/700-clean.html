<td>Joined by Kaitlyn Ferencik, from Canyon Ridge Elementary School in Surprise, Arizona, Nancy Pelosi lit the tree in a ceremony on December 8. The tree was felled in early November, and delivered to Washington on November 30. The tree was decorated with 10,000 LEDs, and 5,000 ornaments crafted and donated by the people of Arizona.<br>A significant portion of the ornaments were created by Arizona school children who were provided with specifications for their ornaments, including the instructions that “[o]rnaments cannot reflect a religious or political theme… Instead share your interpretation of our theme ‘Arizona’s Gift, from the Grand Canyon State.’” The ADF sent a letter to various officials associated with the 2009 tree, on the behalf of Candace Duncan, who's child wished to submit ornaments including the following phrases: "Happy Birthday, Jesus," and "Merry Christmas." The ADF made the argument that the child's First Amendment rights were violated by the restrictions. The instructions for the event were modified by October 1, and no longer included the religious restrictions. A spokesperson for the AOC was quoted as saying the previous instruction contained “old information,” and that “is no longer the position of the agency.”</td>
