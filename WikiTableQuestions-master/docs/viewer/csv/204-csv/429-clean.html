<td>Battle of Concepción</td>
<td>San Antonio de Bexar</td>
<td>October 28, 1835</td>
<td>In the last offensive ordered by General Martin Perfecto de Cos during the Texas Revolution, Mexican soldiers surprised a Texian force camped near Mission Concepción. The Texians repulsed several attacks with what historian Alwyn Barr described as "able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower". One Texian was injured, and Richard Andrews became the first Texian soldier to die in battle. Between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed. Historian Stephen Hardin believes that "the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies", which may have led to the later Texian defeat at Coleto.</td>
