Although there are many different dialects and accents, the transcription would be fairly standard.	p	It should be noted that in the Dutch language the word "Afrikaans" means African, in the general sense. Consequently Afrikaans is commonly but incorrectly denoted as "Zuid-Afrikaans". This ambiguity also exists in Afrikaans itself and is either resolved in the context of its usage, or by using "Afrikaan" for an African person, and "Afrika-" in the adjective sense.

Ridgway was sentenced for the deaths of each of these 48 victims, with a plea agreement that he would "plead guilty to any and all future cases (in King County) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence."[21]	ul	Before Ridgway's confession, authorities had not attributed to the Green River Killer the deaths of victims Rule, Barczak, Hayes, Reeves, Yellowrobe and 'victim 49'.[20]\nRidgway's confession and directions led police search crews to find the bodies of Avent, Buttram, and Malvar in August and September 2003.\nOn Tuesday, December 21, 2010, hikers near the West Valley Highway in Auburn, WA found a skull in the vicinity of where Marie Malvar's remains were found in 2003. The skull was identified as belonging to Rebecca "Becky" Marrero, who was last seen leaving the Western Six Motel at South 168th Street and Pacific Highway South on December 3, 1982. The King County Prosecutor confirmed that Ridgway would be formally charged with her murder on February 11, 2011.[21] On February 18, 2011, he entered a guilty plea in the murder of Rebecca Marrero, adding a 49th life sentence to his existing 48. Ridgway confessed to murdering Marrero in his original plea bargain, but due to insufficient evidence, the charges could not be filed. Therefore, there is no change in his current incarceration status.[22]\nThe remains of Tracy Winston were found, without a skull, in Kent's Cottonwood Grove Park in March 1986. Winston's skull was found in November 2005 near Tiger Mountain, miles away from the discovery site of the rest of her body. Police assume someone carried it to the location.[23]\nSandra Denise Major was not identified until June 2012. A family member asked the King County Sheriff to investigate after seeing a TV movie about Ridgway. DNA confirmed Major's identity.[24][25]

Thus, their relative positions change over time, and for the nearer stars this movement can be measured. As a star moves toward or away from us, its apparent brightness changes. Sirius is currently the brightest star in Earth's night sky, but it has not always been so. Canopus has persistently been the brightest star over the ages; other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing our solar system at a much closer distance than Canopus.

On the other hand, there is also no proof that the language has no indigenous words for those numbers. It is intriguing that Rinconada has native words for three-digit numbers (e.g. "sanggatos" for 100) but not for two digit numbers. Utilization and adaptation of foreign words via 333 years of Spanish colonization could be a reason why the native terminologies may not have been passed to the new generations. But a long established language needs a complete numbering system in words. Therefore, the reconstruction of words for 11-99 is necessary but needs to follow and retain the indigenous or original structural form of Rinconada's orthography.

csv/203-csv/195.csv	68316	601271712	0	Heat pump	Efficiency|Coefficient of performance (COP) and lift	COP variation with output temperature	p	The COP increases as the temperature difference, or "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.[citation needed]	p	One observation is that while current "best practice" heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0 °C and 35 °C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental Carnot cycle limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could at least double. Cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better gas compressor, fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow. Depending on the working fluid, the expansion stage can be important also. Work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power. (An evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole, but an ideal gas is not.)

Rudiger Overmans used the description "Poland" to summarize the figures for the region east of the Oder–Neisse line, which included the Former eastern territories of Germany, Danzig, pre war Poland, and the Memel Territory[5] The population surveyed in pre war Poland included Polish citizens on the Volksliste who were of dubious German ancestry.[20] The losses in Poland included deaths in the wartime flight, and post war deaths in the Soviet Kaliningrad region and post war Poland. Confirmed deaths in Poland include 17,209 refugees in Denmark and about 15,000 in Polish internment camps.[21] Figures for the Sudetendeutsch include the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. There was no breakout of the figures showing the age and sex of the population surveyed and the date of the reported deaths or persons missing.

csv/203-csv/260.csv	11262088	602513325	1	List of Presidents of the United States by age	Oldest living United States Presidents		p	Not all presidents live to become the oldest of their time; so far approximately 60% have done so, with 19 presidents never becoming the oldest of their time. Herbert Hoover became the oldest living president when Calvin Coolidge died in 1933 (when Hoover was still president) and remained so until his death, for a record of more than 31 years. Lyndon B. Johnson became the oldest living president after the death of Harry S. Truman, but he outlived Truman by only 27 days. On three occasions the oldest living president lost his title, not by his death, but due to the nation electing a president who was older. Theodore Roosevelt lost his title when William Taft was elected, then four years later Taft lost his title when Woodrow Wilson was elected, and, more recently, Richard Nixon lost his title when Ronald Reagan was elected. Furthermore, although Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest man ever to be a former president, he was the only living president or former president by the end of his term. Consequently, Taft was the oldest living president twice: first during his presidency (having succeeded the younger Roosevelt), and a second time after Wilson (his successor as president but an older man) died.	h2	Sources

Anchored in the recent reports, numbers of health professionals in different parts of the country are lower than what is standard. Especially worsened in agrarian and pastoralist regions. However; the available professionals at the end of HSDP III compared to the HSDP III targets show that the target has been met for community level and most of mid level health professionals. The number has also significantly increased compared to the levels in the pervious HSDPs. However, there is still major gap in highly skilled professionals like Medical doctors, midwives and anesthesia professionals.

This is attributable to a number of factors, including the Protestant Plantation of Ireland, as well as the imposition of the Penal Laws in the Middle Ages, which forced many Irish people to Anglicize their surnames. Also, in the 9th century, Viking invaders brought many Norse names to Ireland that they had already brought to England when they established and settled the Danelaw. Although some Scandinavian names may have been brought to England in pre-Viking times, especially in the North and East (who says?).

There were 11 songs in the final, and the winner was decided by televoting - which was also open to Swiss viewers, since song number 9 was performed by a Swiss act. (Due to their bottom placing in 1998, Switzerland were not taking part.) Michael von der Heide would represent Switzerland in 2010.	p	On March 16, it was announced that the winning song had been released in 1997 by another act and was disqualifed, since entering a cover song was (and still is) contrary to the rules. She would later represent the country in 2002. Wind had represented Germany on three previous occasions: 1985, 1987 and 1992.

It follows confirmation of a presidential appointment by the Senate, or a Congressional-recess appointment by the president. In the case of a recess appointment, the ambassador requires subsequent confirmation by the Senate.\nPresented credentials\nThe date that the ambassador presented his letter of credence to the head of state or appropriate authority of the receiving nation. At this time the ambassador officially becomes the representative of his country. This would normally occur a short time after the ambassador’s arrival on station. The host nation may reject the ambassador by not receiving the ambassador’s letter, but this occurs only rarely.\nTerminated mission\nUsually the date that the ambassador left the country. In some cases a letter of recall is presented, ending the ambassador’s commission, either as a means of diplomatic protest or because the diplomat is being reassigned elsewhere and replaced by another envoy.\nChargé d'affaires\nThe person in charge of the business of the embassy when there is no ambassador commissioned to the host country. See chargé d'affaires.\nAd interim\nLatin phrase meaning "for the time being", "in the meantime". See ad interim.
csv/203-csv/761.csv	12126919	564133873	1	2007 Steelback Grand Prix	Race		h2	Race	p	For the second race in a row rain had a major impact on the proceedings. The race began under cloudy skies and on a track that was still partially damp after heavy rains earlier in the day. Oriol Servia got the best start from the second row and led into the first corner. Trouble began as the cars funneled through turn 3 for the first time. Alex Tagliani contacted Simon Pagenaud, knocking the front wing off Pagenaud's car. Paul Tracy collected the wing but could not see that it remained stuck under his own front wing. Coming out of the fast turn 7 the errant wing began to interfere with Tracy's steering and he hit the outside wall. This set off a chain reaction of carnage behind him as cars behind him rounded the blind turn and were not able thread through the mess. In the end, Tracy, Katherine Legge, Alex Figge, and Tristan Gommendy all ended their races immediately, with Gommendy almost flipping up the back of Jan Heylen, catching air. Heylen was able to limp back to the pits, only to retire (his fourth consecutive retirement since returning to the series), while Graham Rahal was able to return to the race with a new front wing.

This was the first time the America's Cup had needed a sixth race, let alone a seventh.[3]	p	The cup title came down to the seventh and final race. For the seventh and deciding race on 26 September 1983 the wind was light at around eight knots. The pre start was not a typical match race start. “Neither party wanted to make a mistake and end up in the protest room,” Conner would explain later.[4] Liberty won the start by eight seconds ahead of Australia II. Over the course of the race there were three lead changes, as well as relentless pressure as each of the yachts tried to provoke dramatic new turns of events. Because both upwind speeds were nearly identical, the tacking duels were fierce and close. Dramatic winds shifts tested the tacticians on both yachts. On the penultimate leg Australia II passed Liberty. One did not need PJ Montgomery's commentary to realize, in the first minutes of that run, that Australia II was sailing significantly lower and faster than Liberty”.[5] After 47 grueling tacks, Australia II crossed the finish line with a winning margin of 41 seconds, becoming the first successful challenger in the 132 years "since the schooner America won it in a race around England's Isle of Wight in 1851”.[6]

However Russia's reconstruction plan involving 600 million dollars in aid to South Ossetia may have spurred immigration into the de facto independent republic, especially with Russia's movement of 3,700 soldiers into South Ossetia, in order to prevent further incursions.[126] RIA Novosti places the population of South Ossetia at 80,000, although this figure is probably too optimistic.[126] Christianity is the major religion practiced by the Ossetians but Ætsæg Din ("Right Faith", Paganism) and Islam also have followers.[127]	h2	Economy

Since this cannot be done exactly with an even number of possible exponent values, the extra value was given to Emax.

This was due to many of the officers becoming hereditary due to feudalistic practices, thus were too removed from the practical operation of either the state or the Royal Household.[2]

The meat should be allowed to "rest" before being served, which allows for the juices in the center to return to the edges. The whole meat, and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior. The exception is if the meat has been prepared in a sous-vide process, as it will already be at temperature equilibrium. The temperatures indicated above are the peak temperature in the cooking process, so the meat should be removed from the heat source a few degrees cooler.

csv/204-csv/692.csv	5160400	594338220	0	Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker	Reception	Review scores	h2	Reception	p	Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker received fairly decent scores overall, gaining an average of 76% on Metacritic.[16] GameSpot's Austin Shau gave the game a 7.5/10, or "Good", with mostly positive comments, but advised users to approach the intense level-grinding with caution.[3] IGN gave a similar score, 7.9, citing the game's excellent graphics and over all quality. IGN stated that the game "should definitely surprise some newcomers to the franchise in the sheer amount of depth and versatility it presents."[17] Nintendo Power gave the game 8/10, and defended Joker, saying it was not just a Pokémon pretender.[18] Similarly, GameSpy gave Joker an 8/10, and enforced the idea that the game is more than just a copy of Pokémon.[19] Gamezone also gave the game a positive review with a score of 8/10.[20] However, GamePro, who gave Joker a 3.25/5, felt the game was just "another monster catch-and-battle game" along the lines of Pokémon. The review also cited the Scouting to be tricky and that the battle camera can be annoying.[21] Game Informer gave the game 8/10, with the game receiving the "Handheld Game of the Month" for the December 2006 issue. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game a positive review with a total score of 36/40.[22]

Although the first four titles were announced, only three were published and subscribers were told the series had been postponed. However, the series was relaunched in January 2014 beginning with the same four issues. However, this time the books built up a panoramic picture on the spine by artist Adi Granov. This means collectors who had purchased the original three volumes would have to purchase them again to complete the spine art.	p	In addition, the first issue confirmed that future volumes would feature Iron Man, Thor, The X-Men, Silver Surfer, Black Panther, Captain Britain, Ghost Rider, Iron Fist, Doctor Strange, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, Inhumans and Punisher.
